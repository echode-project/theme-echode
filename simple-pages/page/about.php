    <p class="intro">Echode is an interactive art project in Scotland County, NC that blends multimedia storytelling, historical and cultural documentation, and community engagement to strengthen associations between identity and place. By engaging a broad and diverse audience, we aim to foster connection among people and the places they share.</p>
    <h2>History and Funding</h2>
    <p>Echode is funded by a 2-year N.C. Arts Council, a division of the Department of Cultural Resources, grant administered through the <a href="http://www.storyartscenter.org">Storytelling &amp; Arts Center of the Southeast</a>. Matching funding is provided by <a href="http://www.servicethread.com">Service Thread Manufacturing</a>, and the Laurinburg Downtown Revitalization Corporation.</p>
    <p>Launched in May, 2015 the first 12 calendar months are dedicated to the development and promotion of a custom, online storytelling platform designed to foster community engagement through shared identity. The second year will consist of public exhibitions and programing featuring the content and story collected online.</p>
